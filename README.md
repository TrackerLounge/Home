# Tracking
[Three Box Tracking Pit for the Home Shop](https://github.com/TrackerLounge/ThreeBoxTrackingPitForTheHomeShop)
A tracking pit is used to study pressure releases in a track to determine the speed, direction and body position of a individual or animal at that snapshot in time. This page describes a small tracking pit setup ideal when space is limited consisting of 3 boxes containing: hard packed sand, moist soft sand, and dry loose sand.  

[Tracking and Photogrammetry](https://github.com/TrackerLounge/TrackingAndPhotogrammetry)
Convert pictures of a track or foot print into a digital model of the track for further forensic analysis. This can also aid in examining pressure releases. Such a digital model can server as a useful teaching aid.

[Experiments with Image Processing, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning and Tracking](https://github.com/TrackerLounge/TrackingAndComputerVision)
Experiment with Machine Learning to identify a footprint as 'right' or 'left'
Experiment to identify the edge of a track or footprint using edge detection to improve the ability of TensorFlow to identify a foot print as 'right' or 'left' 
Experiment to see if additional pre-processing could improve edge detection on a foot print in sand or dirt. This included coloring the track based on the Z-axis (or by elevation) and adding topographic lines to the track and surrounding surface. 
These techniques were utilized to read and evaluate pressure releases in the track.
